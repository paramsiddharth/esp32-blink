# Blinking ESP32
A simple blinking LED programme that may be uploaded
to an ESP32 microcontroller unit.

## Instructions
Assuming `/path/to/port` represents the path to the serial
port the MCU is connected to and listening on, to compile
and upload, execute the following:
```bash
make port=/path/to/port
```

If you wish to listen to the console output using a serial
monitor, the baud rate will be 1,15,200.
